# NUnitTestingTemplate
Template for working with NUnit for unit testing in C#

Created using dotnet core documentation found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-nunit). This repo is mostly for my own purposes when I need to perform unit testing on my projects which I'm doing a lot of in my current Object Oriented Programming unit at Uni.
